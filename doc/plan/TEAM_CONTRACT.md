# Example Team Contract

### As a project team, we promise to:
 * respect each other's ideas and work.
 * communicate with the team regularly to keep everyone in the loop about the project.
 * each team member will do work to the best of his/her ability and on time and provide commitments others on the team can rely on.
 * vote for big decisisons so everyone's opinion is accounted for.
 * make sure to not miss meetings and meet deadlines set by the team


### Team meetings: 
* when and how often to meet (at least once a week);

        We plan to meet twice a week. Once on Sunday at 1pm and once on Tuesday 4pm.

* how to communicate action items made during the meeting;

        Everyone will have five to ten minutes to update the team on what they worked on during the days prior to the meeting.

* policy for a team member to give advance notice of missing a team meeting and work required to make up for it;

        Let the team know at least 2 hours before meeting if the person can't make it, we will take notes on a general google doc to make sure that person knows what are the updates, and he or she needs to read it before next meeting.

* policy for handling disagreements, major decisions, or priorities during the meeting

        We will vote on big decisions, and majority wins, so that everyone takes a part in the decision.


### Communications:
* choose a preferred channel of communication (e.g., Zoom, e-mail, WhatsApp, Slack, etc.);

        imessage will be our preferred channel of communication.

* decide on an acceptable response policy (e.g., respond within 24 hours);

        Respond within 24 hours.

* policy for keeping everyone up-to-date on major decisions, changes, or updates.

        Keep a google doc with important decisions and updates of each meeting.

### Helping each other: 
* confirm each team member will ask for help when needed;
        Everyone is welcome to ask for help on the group chat on imessage or to anyone individually.

* confirm each team member will "go above and beyond" as needed to support the team and even other teams
        To make sure everyone will "go above and beyond" to support the team, we compromise to keep everyone update on every decision always.

### Commitments:
* policy for resolving failure to meet commitments;

        If someone on our team breaks one or more of these promises, the team may:
        * have a team meeting and ask the person to follow this agreement.
        * report the issue in the Team Sprint Report.

* policy for reaching out to instructors if commitment issues cannot be resolved within the team 

        If the person breaks the commitments more than 3 times we will have a group meeting and decide collectively what is the best action to take.
