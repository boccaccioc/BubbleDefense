### Project goals

Create a complex tower defense game that has multiple levels and towers. Have towers be able to have dynamic interactions with
what is being defended against, including the ability to select how the tower targets (First, Last, Close, Strongest).

### Project Emphasis

Adhere to the coding principles that we have been taught to allow for our program to be open to enhancement.

### Project Progress

#### Sprint 1 (Test)

Make one level and tower and abstractions to allow for new levels and towers to be easily added. Have basic implementation of
a view to allow for us to visual see if the back end is functioning, and determine how to use sprites in JavaFX.

#### Sprint 2 (Basic)

Improve upon the view, attempt to implement animations. Create new levels and towers using the abstractions created in the
first sprint. Allow for data on levels to be read in from a properties file. Implement banking system, increase money when "enemies"
are popped, have money be consumed when placing towers. Create life system, lives lost when enemies reach end of track.

#### Sprint 3 (Complete)

Refine backend, fix bugs. Implement CSS themes into view and create a pause menu, possibly with a settings button to toggle certain features.
More complex levels with special interations (level moves as it progresses or multiple tracks on a single level to defend). Create upgrade
system for towers in exchange for money. Sounds for when enemy are popped and background music.
